## Quick review

I installed Visual Studio Code (v. 0.10.3 on Windows 7 with 8 GB of memory).
I opened it, it starts reasonably fast.
It has a dark UI, which I don't like, but I quickly found where to change this to the default light theme. Good point than several themes are bundled by default: no need to hunt for them.

Surprisingly, drag'n'drop of code isn't enabled.
Apparently, it doesn't even exist!

Same for column (rectangular) selections!

End of test... See you later.
