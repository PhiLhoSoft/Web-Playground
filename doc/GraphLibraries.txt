List of JavaScript graph libraries

A graph library is able to display of nodes linked by edges.

Important choice criteria are:
- technology: canvas (bitmap) vs. SVG (vector).
- look: apparently some libraries can only do "data cloud" style, with (generally) lot of nodes, with radiating links, more or less stable / random; others can add constraints, allowing to display the nodes in "hierarchical" style, eg. aligned for the same level of depth, etc.
- size (I listed the minimized (uncompressed) file).
- liveness of the project (last activity since March 31).
